# arduChat
First project with Arduino Giga R1 Wifi and Api of OpenAi


This code sets up an Arduino device to connect to a WiFi network and send a request to the OpenAI API asking "What is Arduino?" through an HTTP POST request. It displays various messages on an OLED screen throughout the process, including showing a startup message, connecting to WiFi, connecting to the API server, and displaying the response received from the API in JSON format. The code uses various libraries and includes a header file containing sensitive data such as the WiFi network SSID and password and the OpenAI API key. The overall vibe is that the Arduino device is a superhero with superpowers.
